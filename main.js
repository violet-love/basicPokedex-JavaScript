    //a callback function to take the data from out newly converted json data and insert it into our appropriate DOM elements
    .then((data) => {
      //create a format appropriate pokemon id in order to plug into the pokemon.com image url
      var id = ('00' + data.id).slice(-3);
      //change the background image of the image screen element to the appropriate pokemon image
      imageScreen.style.backgroundImage = `url('https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/${id}.png')`;
